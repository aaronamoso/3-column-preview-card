Things I struggled with:
- I do need help with making my styles.css a bit less. I seem to get lost in the margin or padding or mainly just positioning the elements to the right place.
- I also struggled with the hover button. I seem to get it but the text disappears when I hover my cursor over it.
- The whole preview card is not centered as i intended to do--you can see that on my css -- so any feedback will be much appreciated!
